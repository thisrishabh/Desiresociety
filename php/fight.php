	<p>We believe good health care is everyone’s right. Yet 400 million people in the world can’t afford or don’t have access to basic health care.
Disease results in misery, pain, and poverty for millions of people worldwide. That’s why treating and preventing disease is so important to us. We lead efforts both large and small. We set up temporary clinics, blood donation centers, and training facilities in underserved communities struggling with outbreaks and health care access. We design and build infrastructure that allows doctors, patients, and governments to work together.

Our members combat diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and polio. Prevention is important, which is why we also focus on health education and bringing people routine hearing, vision, and dental care.
Fighting Disease
Fighting Disease
The body can fight or protect against disease in a lot of ways.

Immune system

Your blood is filled with white blood cells. These white blood cells protect your body against pathogens in three ways:

They can engulf the ‘foreign’ cell and digest them. This is called phagocytosis.
They can produce antitoxins - antitoxins counteract the toxins that invading bacteria may produce.
They produce antibodies - this is a bit more complicated… so we’ll talk about that now!</p>
