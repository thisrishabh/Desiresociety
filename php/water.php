	Clean Water Fund is focused principally on the development of environmental leadership, bringing together and working in collaboration with different constituencies to improve lives, while focusing on environmental, consumer and community problems. Ever since its inception in 1978, this organization has aided in the successful campaigning for safer and cleaner water and air, and protection from toxic pollution. These programs are complemented by Clean Water Action, which has played a major role in developing, strengthening, and defending the major water and toxic laws in the nation, especially as many drinking water sources are continually threatened by overconsumption, pollution, and even climate change.</h1>
